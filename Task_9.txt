9. Reflection

	1. I learn basic c++ syntax, like cin, printf_s().
	   
	2. Learning a new computer langues, whitch was overcome
	   mostly by a lot of googeling and looking att exampels.
	   Also understanding git hub whitch has mostly been a 
	   bunch of trail and error.

 
	3. More exampel of the result of the code. (like how the peramids
	   was shown in Task 8).




Obs - prime nr v2 is the one that works not the other prime nr one. And it is the code in the files that are the finnish ones.
